# Number-Recognition
A short Python-Script for number recognition with the MNIST-Dataset

With this Script it is possible to recognize Numbers trained with the MNIST-Dataset.
At the moment it is very simple. You can to create a small grayscale image (64x64 pixel)
and use this for testing. Under "custom_image_path" you have to set the path to this image.
After running the script it will take a while (depending on your system) until training is 
finished. The number you have choosen will be displayed in an new window showing the
accuracy and the recognized number.
